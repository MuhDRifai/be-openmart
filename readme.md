# OpenMart E-Commerce API Documentation

Welcome to the OpenMart E-Commerce API documentation. This project involves the development of CRUD APIs for an e-commerce website known as OpenMart.com. These APIs enable the management of users, products, orders, and more.

## Introduction

The OpenMart E-Commerce API project aims to provide a comprehensive set of APIs for managing various aspects of the e-commerce website OpenMart.com. The APIs are designed to facilitate the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of essential data entities such as users, products, and orders. By utilizing these APIs, developers can seamlessly integrate and interact with the OpenMart platform, enabling the development of applications that utilize the website's e-commerce functionalities.

### Key Features

- **User Management**: CRUD operations for managing user accounts, profiles, and authentication.
- **Product Management**: APIs for handling products, including creation, listing, updating, and deletion.
- **Order Management**: APIs to manage customer orders, including order creation, tracking, and history.
- **Cart Management**: APIs to handle shopping carts, enabling users to add, modify, and review cart contents.

Whether you're building a mobile app, a web application, or any other software solution that requires interaction with an e-commerce platform, the OpenMart E-Commerce APIs provide the necessary tools to streamline the development process.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repo**: Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MuhDRifai/be-openmart.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned project directory and install all dependencies:

   ```
   cd be-openmart
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**: Make sure you have a `.env` file in the project directory with required configurations (API keys, database info, etc.).

4. **Run the Server**: Once dependencies are installed and the environment is configured, start the server with the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the server using nodemon, which automatically restarts the server on code changes.

Feel free to explore the API endpoints, test functionalities, and integrate them into your applications.
